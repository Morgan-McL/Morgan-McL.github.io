# Welcome to my website!

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Case Western Reserve University. My research interests focus mainly on child and adolescent mental health, including family and parent-child relationships, parenting interventions, and youth experiences of mental health treatment. 

I received my bachelor's degree from the University of California, Irvine and worked as a K-12 educator in several settings in Los Angeles before transitioning to psychology. Prior to starting graduate school I held research positions with Dr. Jessica Borelli and Dr. Belinda Campos (both at UC Irvine), and Dr. Daniel Shaw (at the University of Pittsburgh). I have experience with both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, primarily with young children (age 6 and under) and their families.
