My research interests focus mainly on child and adolescent mental health, including family and parent-child relationships, parenting interventions, and youth experiences of mental health treatment.\nI received my bachelor’s degree from the University of California, Irvine and worked as a K-12 educator in several settings in Los Angeles before transitioning to psychology. Prior to starting graduate school I held research positions with Dr. Jessica Borelli and Dr. Belinda Campos (both at UC Irvine), and Dr. Daniel Shaw (at the University of Pittsburgh). I have experience with both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, primarily with young children (age 6 and under) and their families.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "Re-reading the special issue of American Statistician on “Moving to a World Beyond p &lt; .05”, I founding myself repeating one of the mantras of behavioral parent training–“focus on what you want, not what you don’t want.” To be effective, parents are instructed to give children clear positive alternatives instead of just telling them to stop misbehaving. This applies as well to clinicians coaching parents–instructing a parent to stop yelling won’t get you as far as showing them a clear alternative–like positively reinforcing a child’s’ good behavior.\nScientists and students seeking more rigorous research results, perhaps, are not so different from parents trying to coax better behavior out of their children. As I re-read the editorial by Wasserstein, Schirm, and Lazar, I nodded along with the authors’ (now-familiar) criticisms of p-values and significance thresholds, while silently asking “what do we do instead?” The authors clearly anticipate such concerns–the first section of their article is called “’Don’t Is Not Enough”–yet their overview of what to do ends up being exponentially longer than their short list of what not to do, with much of the advice proving vague or contradictory (as many of the individual authors of the special issue articles do not themselves agree on what should count as best practice in statistics). It wouldn’t surprise me if many scientists have responded to these recommendations roughly the same way as a parent who, shortly after being told to stop yelling at their child, is given a 500-page scholarly book on parenting. \nThe problem is not the advice itself–which I have no doubt is sound and rigorous–but, to deploy another parent-training mantra:  “children [and scientists] respond to incentives.” Just as a child will continue misbehaving in spite of parental commands if their misbehavior is otherwise rewarded, scientists can know internally that a particular practice is flawed or problematic, but will continue engaging in it if they receive professional rewards or benefits from doing so. Or, as Steven Goodman writes in his contribution to the special issues, the “basic explanation” for the universal use of p-values is the fact that they are universally used: “It is the same reason we can use money. When everyone believes in something’s value, we can use it for real things; money for food, and P-values for knowledge claims, publication, funding, and promotion. It does not matter if the P-value does not mean what people think it means; it becomes valuable because of what it buys.” Put another way, many of the criticisms of p-values and significance thresholds–that they oversimplify to the point of misrepresentation, that they falsely dichotomize between “significant” and “non-significant” results–are precisely why they have become so widely used: they provide a simplified and easy-to-digest (even if false and misleading) representation of research results. Researchers have decades of experience operating within a system that grants professional rewards to those using significance thresholds. Currently, I can envision only two plausible pathways away from such flawed practices. Either research fields need to converge on a viable consensus to replace the longstanding dominance of p-values and significance thresholds (rather than the range of conflicting opinions represented in the special issue). If such a simple consensus replacement is not possible, then scientific institutions (including journals, universities, and funding bodies) need to at least remove the incentives for engaging in flawed practice, so that a diverse range of less flawed practices can flourish."
