The FCUO includes live video-call sessions with a trained parent coach, as well as a mobile parenting app. Participation can be completed in as few as two sessions, and because the intervention is fully remote, it is far more accessible to busy parents, particularly those living in remote areas.",

My research interests focus mainly on child and adolescent mental health, including family and parent-child relationships, parenting interventions, and youth experiences of mental health treatment.\nI received my bachelor’s degree from the University of California, Irvine and worked as a K-12 educator in several settings in Los Angeles before transitioning to psychology. Prior to starting graduate school I held research positions with Dr. Jessica Borelli and Dr. Belinda Campos (both at UC Irvine), and Dr. Daniel Shaw (at the University of Pittsburgh). I have experience with both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, primarily with young children (age 6 and under) and their families.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
